# unity-license-activate
> A tool to automate the manual activation of unity license using puppeteer

This is a fork from [MizoTake/unity-license-activate](https://github.com/MizoTake/unity-license-activate).

For Unity personal license (free version) , you most likely would have to renew
it every period of time. Then you would have to repeat the step [Activation - Personal License](https://game.ci/docs/github/activation#personal-license)
after some times. This tool is designed to use with [GameCI](https://game.ci/),
so you can do the CI/CD tasks without bothering by the Unityâ€™s licensing system.
