# unity-license-activate
> A tool to automate the manual activation of unity license using puppeteer

This is a fork from [MizoTake/unity-license-activate](https://github.com/MizoTake/unity-license-activate).

This tool is design to use with [GameCI](https://game.ci/) and personal license
(free version) users. Personal license will expire after some times, then you most
likely would have to repeast the step [Activation - Personal License](https://game.ci/docs/github/activation#personal-license)
in order to keep the CI running. Thankfully, you can use this tool to constantly
activate a new license from Unity's licensing system.
